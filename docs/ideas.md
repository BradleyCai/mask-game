# Rooms

- [ ] Move ball around with height map 
- [ ] Intersection creates walkway
- [ ] one contiguous box but can be broke into multiple. Then a height map can be used. So move a box around and make a two step staircase with a height map.
- [ ] Different coloured lights
- [ ] Light reveals a maze. Blacklight that shows up lines drawn on ground. There’s a bit of a memorisation game there
- [ ] The gradient ramp idea to make a staircase
- [ ] Halls connecting puzzle rooms. Maybe at one point a hall has a power outlet that is easy to miss. Easter egg? Plot development?
